# Syllable-Based ARPAsing Phonemizer (ARPAsing plus Phonemizer)
Custom English Arpabet Phonemizer based on Syllable-Based API Phonemizer
 
As of version **`V0.0.55`** and above, it now supports the majority of all ARPAsing voicebanks, also **`V0.0.55`** and above is much more stable than the previous versions of this external Phonemizer.

#### üìç if you want to suggest a feature for ARPA+, you can suggest on the issues tab or the discussions tab
#### üìç if there's any issue with the Phonemizer, you can contact me through my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cadlaxa). Let me know if there's a problem tehee.

 ## Supported Consonants and Vowels
 - **Consonants are automatically supported by this phonemizer but if the consonants aren't listed on the `GetTransitionBasicLengthMs`, their lengths are defaulted to 1.0 ms**
 - **Currently supported vowels:**
   - **`aa`, `ax`, `ae`, `ah`, `ao`, `aw`, `ay`, `eh`, `er`, `ey`, `ih`, `iy`, `ow`, `oy`, `uh`, `uw`, `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `ai`, `ei`, `oi`, `au`, `ou`, `ix`, `ux`,
`aar`, `ar`, `axr`, `aer`, `ahr`, `aor`, `or`, `awr`, `aur`, `ayr`, `air`, `ehr`, `eyr`, `eir`, `ihr`, `iyr`, `ir`, `owr`, `our`, `oyr`, `oir`, `uhr`, `uwr`, `ur`,
`aal`, `al`, `axl`, `ael`, `ahl`, `aol`, `ol`, `awl`, `aul`, `ayl`, `ail`, `ehl`, `el`, `eyl`, `eil`, `ihl`, `iyl`, `il`, `owl`, `oul`, `oyl`, `oil`, `uhl`, `uwl`, `ul`,
`naan`, `an`, `axn`, `aen`, `ahn`, `aon`, `on`, `awn`, `aun`, `ayn`, `ain`, `ehn`, `en`, `eyn`, `ein`, `ihn`, `iyn`, `in`, `own`, `oun`, `oyn`, `oin`, `uhn`, `uwn`, `un`,

    - **üìç note: if the custom vowels are not here on the list or in the code, they will be recognized as consonants, Syllable-based Phonemizers will have to define all possible vowels in order to them to be recognized as a Vowel**

 ## Mechanics of the Phonemizer

### How syllables work
- **Syllables are built like:**

  - Starting C: `[- c]`
  - Starting CV: `[- c v]` or `[- cv]`
  - Starting CCV: `[- ccv]` or `[- cc v]`
  - Starting V: `[- v]` or `[v]`
  - VV: `(Fallbacks to [v c][c v]/[cv] then [c v]/[cv] then [v], if vb doesn't have [v], glottal stop are used instead)`
  - Connecting CV: `[c v]` (Fallbacks to `[cv]`if no alias is detected)
  - Connecting CCV: `[ccv] ` or `[cc v]`
  - Connecting VC: `[v c]` then `[v -]` `[- c`
  - Connecting CC: `[c c]` (with consonant fallbacks) then `[c1 -]` `[- c2]`
  - Connecting CCC: `[c cc]` (fallbacks to `[c c]`)
  - Ending C: `[c -]`
  - Ending V: `[v -]`

- **Phoneme length are specified directly to the phonemizer:**
  - Default transition in ms: '1.0'
  - Vowels: 'default'
  - Consonants: '1.3'
  - Affricates: '1.5'
  - Long Consonants: '2.3'
  - Semi-long Consonants: '1.3'
  - Tap Consonant: '0.5'
  - Glide Consonants: '2.5'
 - - - -
### Vowel and Consonant Fallbacks
- **This custom Phonemizer supports vowel and consonant fallbacks:**
  - CV/CCV Fallback: `[cc v]` or `[ccv]` and `[c v]` or `[cv]`
  - VV Fallback: `([v c][c v]/[cv] then [c v]/[cv] then [v], if vb doesn't have [v], glottal stop are used instead)``
  - Connecting VC/VCC Fallback: `[v c]` then `[v -]` `[- c]`
  - Connecting CC/CCC: `[c c]` (with consonant fallbacks) then `[c1 -]` `[- c2]`
  - Starting and Ending Consonants
