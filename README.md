 ## Mechanics of the Phonemizer

### How syllables work
- **Syllables are built like:**

  - Starting C: `[- c]`
  - Starting V: `[- v]`
  - VV: `(Fallbacks to [V C][C V]/[CV] then [C V]/[CV] then finally [V])`
  - Connecting CV: `[c v]` (Fallbacks to `[CV]`if no alias is detected)
  - Connecting VC: `[v c]`
  - Connecting CC: `[c c]` (with consonant fallbacks)
  - Ending C: `[c -]`
  - Ending V: `[v -]`

- **Phoneme length are specified directly to the phonemizer:**
  - Default transition in ms: '1.0'
  - Vowels: 'default'
  - Consonants: '1.3'
  - Affricates: '1.5'
  - Long Consonants: '2.3'
  - Semi-long Consonants: '1.3'
  - Tap Consonant: '0.5'
  - Glide Consonants: '2.5'
 - - - -
### Vowel and Consonant Fallbacks
- **This custom Phonemizer supports vowel and consonant fallbacks:**
  - CV Fallback: `[c v]` or `[CV]`
  - VV Fallback: `(Fallbacks to [V C][C V]/[CV] then [C V]/[CV] then finally [V])`
  - Connecting VC Fallback: `[v c]`
