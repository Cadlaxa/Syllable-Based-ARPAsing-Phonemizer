# Syllable-Based ARPAsing Phonemizer
Custom English Arpabet Phonemizer based on Syllable-Based API Phonemizer
 
~~This Phonemizer was optimized for **`Arpasing 0.1.0`** and **`Arpasing 0.2.0`** banks **(the original list, Kanru Hua made)** made for [Openutau](https://www.openutau.com/). This Phonemizer works with other ARPAsing banks with CC, VV, CV, and VC fallback plus constant uniformed phoneme lengths.~~

As of version **`V0.0.55`** and above, it now supports the majority of all ARPAsing voicebanks, also **`V0.0.55`** and above is much more stable than the previous versions of this external Phonemizer.

 ## Mechanics of the Phonemizer

### How syllables work
- **Syllables are built like:**

  - Starting C: `[- c]`
  - Starting CV: `[- c v]` or `[- cv]`
  - Starting V: `[- v]` or `[v]`
  - VV: `(Fallbacks to [V C][C V]/[CV] then [C V]/[CV] then finally [V])`
  - Connecting CV: `[c v]` (Fallbacks to `[CV]`if no alias is detected)
  - Connecting VC: `[v c]`
  - Connecting CC: `[c c]` (with consonant fallbacks) then `[c1 -]` `[- c2]`
  - Ending C: `[c -]`
  - Ending V: `[v -]`

- **Phoneme length are specified directly to the phonemizer:**
  - Default transition in ms: '1.0'
  - Vowels: 'default'
  - Consonants: '1.3'
  - Affricates: '1.5'
  - Long Consonants: '2.3'
  - Semi-long Consonants: '1.3'
  - Tap Consonant: '0.5'
  - Glide Consonants: '2.5'
 - - - -
### Vowel and Consonant Fallbacks
- **This custom Phonemizer supports vowel and consonant fallbacks:**
  - CV Fallback: `[c v]` or `[CV]`
  - VV Fallback: `(Fallbacks to [V C][C V]/[CV] then [C V]/[CV] then finally [V])`
  - Connecting VC Fallback: `[v c]`
  - Connecting CC: `[c c]` (with consonant fallbacks) then `[c1 -]` `[- c2]`
  - Starting and Ending Consonants
