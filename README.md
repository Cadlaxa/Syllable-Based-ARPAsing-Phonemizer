 ## Mechanics of the Phonemizer

### How syllables work
**Syllables are built like this:**

- Starting C: [- c]
- Starting V: [- v]
- VV: (with V and CV fallbacks if there's so VV available on the bank)
- Connecting CV: [c v]
- Connecting VC: [v c]
- Connecting CC: [c c] (with consonant fallbacks)
Batchim (syllable finals): [v C] (required);
- Ending C: [c -]
- Ending V: [v -]
- Fallback phonemes: [dx, zh, dr, tr]
